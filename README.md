# Mastermind

The majority of this Gem was created by Jonathan Yiv as an assignment for TheOdinProject.

I have added testing, some minor syntactical changes, and applied Rubocop suggestions...mostly.

Instead of using the assignment from TheOdinProject to build a game that's been done many times, I chose instead to use this assignment to learn about deciphering someone else's code, and learning how to use RSpec.

Prior to completing this assignment, I had very little exposure to RSpec. I wrote many tests for a lot of the methods in this Gem, though it's my first time looking at an existing code base and essentially creating tests from nothing.

This was definitely a worthwhile experience and I strongly encourage anyone else following along the TOP curriculum to consider doing the same!

Enjoy!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mastermind'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mastermind

## Usage

If you have this Gem locally on your machine, you should be able to run the `$ ruby engine.rb` command in your console/terminal...depending on where your working directory currently is...

If you're in the correct directory but still don't see the game, you'll need to uncomment the last two lines of the `engine.rb` file and then run `$ ruby engine.rb`

Enjoy!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
