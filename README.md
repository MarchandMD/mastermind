# Mastermind

The majority of this Gem was created by [Jonathan Yiv](https://github.com/JonathanYiv) as an assignment for [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).

I have added testing, some minor syntactical changes, and applied Rubocop suggestions...mostly.

Instead of using the assignment from TheOdinProject to build a game that's been done many times, I chose instead to use this assignment to learn about deciphering someone else's code, and learning how to use RSpec.

Prior to completing this assignment, I had very little exposure to RSpec. I wrote many tests for a lot of the methods in this Gem, though it's my first time looking at an existing code base and essentially creating tests from nothing.

This was definitely a worthwhile experience and I strongly encourage anyone else following along the TOP curriculum to consider doing the same!

Enjoy!
